# JS Machine Coding Concepts

This folder contains JavaScript code implementations demonstrating new concepts and machine coding challenges. The project focuses on JavaScript concepts like **bind**, **apply**, their **polyfills**, and **Proxy**.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. **bind()**:
   - The `bind()` method is used to create a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

### 2. **apply()**:
   - The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but the difference lies in how arguments are passed. The `apply()` method takes an array or array-like object of arguments.

### 3. **Polyfills for `bind()` and `apply()`**:
   - These polyfills allow us to implement the `bind()` and `apply()` methods in environments that might not support them (e.g., older versions of JavaScript).

### 4. **Proxy**:
   - The `Proxy` object enables you to create a handler for an object and intercept operations like property access, assignment, function calls, etc.
